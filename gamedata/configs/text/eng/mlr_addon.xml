		<text>Any free info can you share about the surrounding area?</text>

	<string id="talk_to_maps_1">
		<text>Usually info is how I make a living, but since everything's quiet anyway, I can give you a bit of an insight.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_2">
		<text>I'm all ears.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_3">
		<text>Well, you're in Rostok. It's completely safe for anyone on good terms with Duty. To the west lies the Wild Territory, former western part of the Rostok factory. Rumors advise against going there at night. The best kill zones are held by the mercs, so you'll likely be getting shot from two sides. There are mutants in the lower lands, and it's better to stay at a height provided by warehouses... Although, the mercs have them covered. That's all about the Wild Territory. To the north lie the Army Warehouses, held by Duty's "best friend", Freedom. There's nothing particularly interesting going on there, but it's the last shelter around for sane people. To the east is the Truck Cemetery - stock up on anti-radiation supplies and ammo if you're going there. There are a lot of mutants and sometimes the radiation is way past what even we consider to be normal. To the south is the Garbage - complete anarchy going on over there... You've got mutants and thugs, but you've also got a neat marketplace. Plus, there's some kind of hunter in the train hangar who might have some jobs to offer. That's all for the roundabouts, need anything else?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_4">
		<text>You mentioned something about a shelter for sane people?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_5">
		<text>Well, north of the warehouses is the Radar, an eerie place held by the Monolith. It's best to stay away from there - no way of getting in with the psy-installation they've got set up.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="talk_to_maps_6">
		<text>Thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dolg_m_0">
		<text>Tell me about yourself.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_1">
		<text>I used to be stationed at the Agroprom Research Institute before I got a promotion. Before the Zone came into existence, I was a car mechanic. Duty noticed my skills as a handyman after I had been around for a while, so they decided to assign me as technician here. I prefer tinkering with heavy firearms and assault weapons... hate working on snipers.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_2">
		<text>What's that smell? Didn't think Duty allowed drinking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_3">
		<text>Man, it's hard getting by without a drink... The work is pretty tedious, and boring. I wish I could go back to the Agroprom, but our base there is gone now. If I hadn't been relocated, I don't even know if I'd be alive - they say the base was lost during an emission in twenty-eleven... Huh, looks like we've gone way off topic. Anyway, don't be shy, now - show me your toys if you need 'em fixed.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dolg_m_4">
		<text>I'll see if I have anything.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_b_cs_0">
		<text>What can you tell me about Cold?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
		<text>What can I say? He's earned quite a bit of respect as the current leader of our organization.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader - who, by the way, I personally never met - and he didn't seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn't worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the Renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero... and the sacrifices on the way to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the swamps, turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction's resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There's more to it... After our troops had returned, we had to start a long war to take everything back. We wouldn't be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He received some help from unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with people throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn't hurt. Moreover, he's given an order to all fighters - without exceptions - not to leave here. We'll take any help, but we won't risk the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>Whoever Lebedev was and what he did, you aren't the same faction you used to be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
		<text>That's your opinion. Certainly has some value to it. Right now, we have no large-scale goals, nor any common ideology... Anyway, it's probably time we cut the storytelling and start the trading.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_8">
		<text>Deal.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="story_dog_0">
		<text>Whose pseudodog is that?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_1">
		<text>That's Buddy, the Doctor's dog. Doctor asked Cold to keep him safe, as he's started getting a little old.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_2">
		<text>Well, by the looks of it, you wouldn't say that he needs it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_3">
		<text>Looks can be deceiving sometimes. Pet a kind-hearted creature. Now, can I tell you about these dogs and answer your questions?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_4">
		<text>Go ahead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_5">
		<text>Pseudodogs aren't really dogs at all. They kind of originate from wolves - Duty learned that while researching them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_6">
		<text>That's... I need to write that down. What's the request, anyway?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_7">
		<text>By virtue of my profession, I collect all sorts of stories. To the north, there's a place similar to our swamps called Zaton. I've heard there's an old crank that lives in the old barge, and apparently, he also has a pseudodog. Perhaps you can find out if it's true, if the distance doesn't bother you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_8">
		<text>I'll check if possible.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="aslan_st_0">
		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_1">
		<text>Well, the Syndicate only has one central base in the Zone, and it's right here. The path to Yantar is cut off because of the psy-installation, and crowds of zombies sometimes come out of there, along with mutants. Limansk has gone to shit - it's a maze full of dangers. The Red Forest is even more dangerous, since Monolith fighters have settled at the bridge to Limansk while the rest of the area is crawling with mutants. At the Army Warehouses in the east, it's all Freedom territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_2">
		<text>Go on.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_3">
		<text>As for any dangers, you'll see those for yourself. Keep in mind, though; when carrying out orders, you've got a job to do, and any emotions are just gonna distract you. Put those aside... There's no room for emotion, no room for morality - only intellect and calculation. And regarding other paths, the safest route is through Limansk. There's plenty of closed space where you'll be safe from sniper fire, and there is shelter where you can hide from firefights, as well as anomalies. The area's quite unpredictable, however - never gonna know what exactly's around the corner.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_4">
		<text>You say the base is central. Does that mean there are any other outposts?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_5">
		<text>There are two minor ones that I know of. The first one is in Zaton, at the edge of the northern marshes. The second one is in the southwest part of the Pripyat outskirts. We've also got a group stationed in the Wild Territory, and you can find our squads in different parts of the Zone when they carry out contracts.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_6">
		<text>So anything north of Limansk is Monolith territory.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_7">
		<text>Pretty much. There's an old hospital not far from Limansk. No point in going there - the path to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the one leading to Yantar are both cut off by psy-emissions.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="aslan_st_8">
		<text>Understood, thanks for the info.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="sultan_st_0">
		<text>Who are you?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_1">
		<text>Congratulations - with a memory like that, you'll be the next Strelok. Listen carefully. I'm the big dog here, and you will know my name. I got here from Zaton some time ago, along with my guys. We fucked the mutants out of the base and got it back up and running. Some sod set us up, pretended to be one of us and ratted me out. Had to get the fuck out.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_2">
		<text>These rooks don't even know the rules, copping the made guys like that. Whatever that douchebag's name was, I'm going to rip him a new one.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_3">
		<text>His name was Sashenka or something - and stay out of his ass. Your prick's tiny, and his asshole is a metal maze.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_4">
		<text>Got it. Any tips on others in the Zone?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_5">
		<text>Simple. Don't trust anybody but our guys with skulls on their sleeves. Pretty much everyone else is hostile - remember that. Just try to figure things out for yourself. If you feel something's off, get your ass out of there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_6">
		<text>Got it. Any safe places I can stay?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_7">
		<text>No such place as safe in the Zone, boy, but don't let this advice go to waste. North of us is the Truck Cemetery, and our boys there control the old checkpoint and the entrance to the Army Warehouses. Try not to hang around the cemetery at night, and stay away from all the old vehicles. Radiation levels there are high enough to make your counter ring down to your balls, and I haven't even mentioned the creatures and anomalies. There's the Garbage to the west - total chaos over there. I can't say anything else, other than there's a checkpoint to the north controlled by Duty. There's a huge forest to the south called Darkscape - really wild place, you've got soldiers patrolling there from time to time and loners pissing about. Pretty big maze. Also, there are a few stalkers at the farm on the way to the Darkscape, so don't fuck around. There's a huge advantage in that forest: the road leads to the Cordon. You'll easily find our guys at the vehicle station there.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_8">
		<text>That's kind of scary.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_9">
		<text>And what did you expect, boy? No sunshine and rainbows - this is the real life.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="sultan_st_10">
		<text>Alright, whatever. Thanks for the help, boss.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_0">
		<text>Why is your nickname so lousy?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_1">
		<text>Look who's talking! Goddamn greenhorns, trying to act all tough... You don't handle them, they can't even hold their own dicks straight when taking a piss. If you do, they act like lousy morons, to put it in your own words.</text>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_2">
		<text>Hey, easy - didn't mean anything by it. Just didn't know what to say.</text>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_3">
		<text>Alright, whatever... Apology accepted. Things ain't easy when you get old and your nerves are fucked.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_4">
		<text>Understood. How did you get your name?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_5">
		<text>I'll tell you, if only to put an end to your yapping. My story began under the Soviet Union, before the first time I ended up in prison. I wanted a good life... Did some trade hustle, and been caught for that one day. So after I did my time, I started making new connections and selling stolen stuff. Did that for three years before I, once again, ended up in jail. Got out, but the USSR was gone... You know what the most frustrating thing was?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_6">
		<text>No. Never saw the Soviet Union at a reasonable age.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_7">
		<text>First time I ended up in prison, it was "business"... or "profiteering", in old Soviet speech. Nowadays, anyone who's successful can end up behind bars. That place is where you feel your ass burning.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_8">
		<text>[continue...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_9">
		<text>When I got out of my second stint, everything crashed down. No income at all, and there were loads of people around who were doing the same thing as I was. When the Zone came into existence, I figured I'd go see it for myself.</text>

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_10">
		<text>[continue...]</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_trader_st_11">

	<string id="bandit_trader_st_12">

	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_3">
		<text>There were times when my face was constantly on a roll of honor... I worked as a mechanical engineer at a plant and got recognized in my company as the best specialist in that profession. They awarded me prizes and certificates.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_4">
		<text>I'm guessing you wanted to get some tail?</text>

	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_6">
		<text>They call you Limpid because you've got something limp down under?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_7">
		<text>Real funny guy. Anyway, I enjoyed hanging out with my guys after a long shift. Had a few too many drinks... The boss caught us, and I got fired like some stupid loser.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_8">
		<text>Life's a bitch.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_9">
		<text>A bitch I doubt you've seen for real. Got a job as an ordinary locksmith and found a new friend by the name of Vitka. Barely got paid jack shit, but thankfully I earned enough to get myself a few rounds once in a while. At one time we got drunk and fucked around... Don't even remember why. Anyway, I stabbed him with a screwdriver - good thing that he didn't die right then and there. Spent a few years in maximum security, and my bitch wife sold everything and ran off. When I got released, I spent all my money on drinks and ended up in the slums... Got here when the Zone came about. Here, everyone's equal: we're all outcasts. I met up with the guys at the Garbage - they found me useful as a technician and let me stay there. Best time in my life... Tons of guns and vodka.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_10">
		<text>This isn't the Garbage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_11">
		<text>Again with your damn interrupting. The big-ass Emission happened, and we hid like little girls. When that nightmare was over with, we had a meeting on where the fuck to go: the Garbage turned out to be a bad shelter from those kinds of emissions. We had to leave it for good and move through different roads in small groups to this place - the Dark Valley.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="bandit_mechanic_st_12">

		<text>What's the current situation?</text>

	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_7">
		<text>Nothing interesting. There's a stalker village a bit to the north... Nothing but hostiles all the way up to Agroprom.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_8">
		<text>So... we're stuck here and in danger of being attacked at any moment?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_9">
		<text>Nah, not too long ago our commanding officers got us a BTR, reinforced our patrols, and our helicopter's always ready to go. By the way, when you leave the checkpoint northside, stay on the road. There's a minefield on both sides.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_south_mechan_mlr_st_10">

	<string id="loki_st_0">
		<text>Are you in charge here?</text>

	<string id="loki_st_1">
		<text>That I am. Name's Loki, right hand of Miklukha at this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>An interesting name - like the Scandinavian deity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>It is. That's what they called me in the early days, right around when the Brain Scorcher showed up. Those were crazy times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Could you tell me more about the events after the Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Sure. When the Scorcher was shut down, my squad launched a campaign towards the north. We went on for some time, going through different places... As the Chernobyl power plant loomed on the horizon, we decided to look for a place to set up camp and found this station while it was empty. The Zone turned to hell, and Duty appeared. The places were strange, there weren't many people, and times were wild with emissions. After calling a truce, we agreed to keep all weapons holstered and knives sheathed in this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>And where is Duty now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>They're not here. Anyone who we didn't manage to shoot down ran off. Not long ago, a stalker by the name of Sasha appeared and helped us out considerably - man did a lot of good things. The last piece of the puzzle he gave us was the PDA of the man who founded Duty, and according to it, he and his group were former military. Seems like he just cut off comms with the headquarters, which made local stalkers go nuts and left enemy forces confused. We kept a careful balance in this station. And thanks to the help of that stalker, we've been getting all kinds of support... from free stalkers, defectors, sympathizers, you name it. We've basically forced Duty out of here.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>And where did the stalker go?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>I don't know. Last time I heard, he was heading towards Jupiter with some kind of fireteam. He was a good man - hopefully he's alive and kicking.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>What makes the local environment dangerous?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>It's full of mutants. On top of that, you've got the Monolith... Those bastards have taken over the old depot and lined the perimeter with scouts and machine guns. Other than that, some areas are crawling with zombies, such as the old village of Kopachy west of us, as well as the ventilation complex and the Volkhov AA complex. Keep your eyes peeled, man.</text>
