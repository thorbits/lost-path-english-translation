		<text>SSP-99 protection suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ecolog_outfit_orn_description">
		<text>The SSP-99 chemical protection suit is specially designed by the Ecologists for use in the Zone. The suit has an integrated air-filtering and air-conditioning system, it is also heat and electricity resistant and provides good protection from radiation and biological anomalies. It is resistant to chemically aggressive environments. It is not designed for combat, so it provides little bullet and splinter protection. The suit has two artefact containers.</text>

		<text>SSP-99M protection suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="ecolog_outfit_grn_description">
		<text>The SSP-99M chemical protection suit is specially designed for scientific expeditions into the Zone. The SSP-99M is a high quality modified SSP-99 suit.

		<text>PS5-M Universal Protection</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_outfit_description">
		<text>This modern version of the Duty bodysuit is better suited for stalkers who are used to or prefer lightweight suits. Unlike the PSZ series, this suit also provides good protection against anomalies. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system instead.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_name">
		<text>PSZ-9d body armour</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This early model of the Duty bodysuit is based on the Spetsnaz PSZ-9 body armour and modified for used in the Zone. The suit is capable of stopping a rifle bullet, however this level of protection comes at the cost of its weight, bulkiness and virtually non-existent anomaly protection. The suit cannot be modified with an artefact container, but may be upgraded with a combat support system.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="dolg_exo_outfit_name">
		<text>Duty exoskeleton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_exo_outfit_description">
		<text>Duty's exoskeleton uses heavier materials to improve bullet resistance over that of others, this version of the exoskeleton though heavy makes one feel like a tank. The only downfall is the weak anomaly protection provided with the armour is very lacking and even the most basic of anomalies can often incapacitate or kill whoever sits inside it. Does not come with an artefact container.</text>

	<string id="dolg_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Duty scientific suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="dolg_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>A wonderful protective suit for the Zone, mostly appreciated because it combines both excellent anomaly and bullet-proofing qualities. It includes the PSZ-9d suit, a closed cycle breathing system and an integrated system of anomalous field suppression. Whilst it provides quality bullet and splinter protection it does not come with an artefact container.</text>

		<text>Sentinel of Freedom</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_description">
		<text>This stalker bodysuit with reinforced body armour made by Freedom craftsmen represents a good compromise between combat and anomaly protection. The built-in body armour comprises armour plating and ten Kevlar layers, capable of stopping a pistol bullet. The suit uses the relatively expensive Sovereign compound for anomaly protection. Comes with an artefact container.</text>

		<text>Wind of Freedom</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_light_outfit_description">
		<text>This lightweight Freedom bodysuit's fabric is treated with "Horizon", a special solution developed by the faction by trial and error to increase resistance to anomalies. Like the Sunrise suit, the Wind of Freedom comes with built-in body armour and artefact container.</text>

    	<text>Guardian of Freedom</text>
  	</string>

  	<string id="svoboda_heavy_outfit_2_description">
    	<text>A modern Freedom model more suitable to new stalker recruits who are used to simpler suits. Unlike the PS3 series, this variation provides decent protection from anomalies and minimal protection from bullets. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

  	<string id="svoboda_exo_outfit_name">
    	<text>Freedom exoskeleton</text>
  	</string>

  	<string id="svoboda_exo_outfit_description">
    	<text>An upgraded version of a regular exoskeleton. The use of lighter materials allowed the designers to reduce the suit's weight and with Freedom's usual trademark of high quality anomaly protection, the only thing that suffers is its overall armour and impact. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>Freedom scientific suit</text>
	</string>

	<string id="svoboda_scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>Produced by Freedom especially for research in the Zone. The closed system of breathing and special treatment materials provide excellent protection against harmful radiation and anomalous effects. However, the built-in body armour isn't the best and can break somewhat easily, so is not suitable for active hostilities. Fully upgradeable and boasting built-in artefact container.</text>

	<string id="novice_outfit_name">
		<text>Leather jacket</text>
	</string>
	<string id="novice_outfit_description">
		<text>The leather jacket does not provide sufficient protection from the Zone's harsh conditions since it's simply a leather anorak. Typically, it is also worn with a backpack with extra straps across the chest. Leather offers little protection from gunfire or claws and is absolutely useless against radiation or anomalies.</text>

	<string id="stalker_outfit_name">
		<text>Sunrise suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="stalker_outfit_description">
		<text>This DIY stalker bodysuit is a combination of twin-layered rubberised cloth with Plexiglas lining and built-in body armour. Despite the fact that the body armour is often strained by anything beyond even pistol bullets, the suit enjoys great popularity due to its low cost and modification potential. Comes with built-in artefact container.</text>

		<text>Exoskeleton</text>
	</string>
	<string id="exo_outfit_description">
		<text>An experimental sample of an exoskeleton that was never mass-produced due to extraordinary cost and design flaws. Despite this, it is in demand due to its ability to take on the weight of all carried equipment, and therefore small batches are made in underground facilities outside of Ukraine. Comes with a built-in artefact container.</text>
	</string>

	<string id="scientific_outfit_name">
		<text>SEVA suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="scientific_outfit_description">
		<text>This suit, produced by one of Kiev's Defence Research Institutes, is a great alternative to home-made stalker suits. The anomaly and radiation protection system is second to none. Fully upgradeable and boasting built-in artefact container, this bodysuit is the equipment of choice for many experienced stalkers.</text>

	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_name">
		<text>Leather trench coat</text>
	</string>
	<string id="trenchcoat_outfit_description">
		<text>A regular black leather trench coat. Has no special purpose other than to keep the wearer warm at night or protect him from a blind dog bite. Although the trench coat is not particularly comfortable, it is often used by bandits in the Zone - either because it allows them to hide in the dark or simply due to its "cool" appearance.</text>

		<text>Bandit mercenary suit</text>
	</string>
	<string id="banditmerc_outfit_description">
		<text>Outfit of choice for the Mercenary faction, recently "liberated" by bandits. The bandit variation suffers from external damage providing less adequate protection across the board, whilst it is not only less costly, it is much easier to get a hold of.</text>

	<string id="st_helm_battle_descr">
		<text>An aluminium/titanium helmet with a cloth exterior that comes with pockets for additional steel armour pieces and an armoured face mask. The Sphere M12 is normally used as part of a combination that includes PSZ series Spetsnaz body armour. Quite popular in the Zone thanks to its respirator and built-in first generation night vision device, as well as providing the maximum head protection possible. Comes with electronics slots.</text>

		<text>Steel helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_hardhat_descr">

		<text>Screen helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_protective_descr">
		<text>A light helmet with an airtight visor intended for protection against anomalies. Judging by the design, the helmet is made by the same Defence Research Institutes as the SEVA suit.

		<text>Tactical helmet</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_tactic_descr">
		<text>A Western model of a tactical helmet, it is not known how it made its way into the Zone. The helmet is designed to provide a squad leader with strategic superiority over the enemy via its many scanners and satellite communications devices, which have not been installed in this particular helmet. Comes with multi-layered Kevlar protection and armoured elements to protect electronic components. Includes a respirator and a first generation night vision device.</text>

		<text>M40 Field Protective Mask</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_helm_m40_descr">
		<text>The M40 was the result of a program in the 1980s to develop a successor to the M17-series protective masks. The M40 was to be a return to conventional gas mask design with an external side-mounted filter canister, rather than the internal cheek filters of the M17, which were awkward to change especially in a contaminated environment. The M40 is favoured amongst many factions, particularly the Mercenaries as while it may lack strong protection vs. anomalies it makes up for this by providing moderate bullet protection.</text>
