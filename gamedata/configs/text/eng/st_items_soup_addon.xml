		<text>Steel wool, also known as wire wool or wire sponge, is a bundle of strands of very fine soft steel filaments. It is used as an abrasive in finishing and repair work for polishing wood or metal objects, cleaning household cookware, and sanding in light painting. Steel wool is made from low-carbon steel (carbon content is low enough to be close to plain iron). It is not made by drawing "steel wool wire" through a tapered die, but rather by a process more like broaching where a heavy steel wire is pulled through a toothed die that removes a thin wire shaving. Bundles of steel wool can be used in precision equipment cleaning and to improve spreading of lubricants and cleaning solvents.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] Х %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] usable for:%c[0,170,170,170] weapon maintenance (+6%)</text>

It was decided to use a highly potent methacrylate which is most often optimized for reacting with either plastic or metal. In case of M17, however, this limitation has been bypassed, making the substance equally effective in both areas. In addition, the adhesive received a significant boost to versatility thanks to its hydrate form: it can be diluted with water and used in any concentration depending on the intended result. There is almost no damage that the glue, combined with appropriate materials, won't be able to repair. Can be used with all materials available in the Zone.\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]PROPERTIES:\n%c[0,153,255,255] Х %c[0,140,140,140] technological item\n%c[0,153,255,255] Х %c[0,140,140,140] high quality\n%c[0,153,255,255] Х %c[0,140,140,140] valuable\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] usable for repairing equipment\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] not usable below condition level: %c[0,170,170,170]60%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] base condition gain: %c[0,170,170,170]6%\n \n%c[0,140,140,140]SUPPORTED MATERIALS:\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] outfit repair kits %c[0,170,170,170]+6-18%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] sewing kits %c[0,170,170,170]+3-9%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] additional adhesives %c[0,170,170,170]+2-6%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] reinforced textile (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+5-6%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] textile (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+3-4%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] cloth (sheets) %c[0,170,170,170]+2-3%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] kevlar plates %c[0,170,170,170]+12%\n%c[255,238,153,26] Х %c[0,140,140,140] steel plates %c[0,170,170,170]+18%</text>

Since then, various kinds of tushonkas have become a primary means of long-time meat preservation, used both by the civilian population and as a standard-issue Red Army food ration. Despite their long expiry date, tushonkas are known for their high nutrition value (mostly owing to high fat content) and a relatively good taste. The Chernobyl Exclusion Zone has seen hundreds of types and tastes of tushonkas.
