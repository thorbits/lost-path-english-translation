I was going to Radar and I managed to negotiate with one squad of mercenaries about a joint sally, since I was a well-known and experienced person, they went to the contact. As it turned out to be mercenaries attacked Dolgovtsy and I was asked to help, I agreed. We joined the detachment of Tirana and acted together.</text>
