			%c[0,153,255,255]Delayed repairs%c[0,140,140,140] allows technicians to retain your equipment.\n
			\n%c[0,0,255,30]Information%c[0,140,140,140]\n
			\nWith this feature enabled, broken weapons, outfits, and other items which you bring to a technician will be kept in their possession until they have completed all repairs.\n
			\nAfter handing over your items you can speak with the technician again to ask whether they are ready for pick-up, to which they will either return them or tell you how much time they still require.\n
			\nThis adds a somewhat realistic enhancement to the traditional repair system, suitable if you are seeking a harder experience, as it will no-longer work instantaneously and instead emphasise the use of gunsmith and sewing kits.\n
			\nThis feature can be toggled from the game options menu and is disabled by default.

			\nThese events and activities can range from something as mundane as complaining about the price of goods sold by a trader, to requesting help from faction allies when under attack.\n
			\nMany other features also tie into the system; stalkers may comment on suspicious activity when you are hunting a bounty, giving you an idea where your target is, or may mention if somebody has a job available.\n

			\nShould Azazel mode be enabled at the same time you will be allowed to continue playing as whoever you switched to, but saves made as your deceased character will be deleted as per usual.\n
			\nNote that all saves in an ironman mode playthrough are tagged with a unique identifier so the game can distinguish between them, making it impossible for unrelated saves to be deleted by mistake.\n

			\nStalker and mutant population factors can be adjusted independently from one another, allowing you to decide how wild or settled the Zone should be without the need to modify any of the game's files.\n
			\nIt should be noted that the effect is greatest when starting a new character, as if the factors are changed during a playthrough in progress, they will only be realised as stalkers and/or mutants die and then respawn in greater or smaller numbers.\n
			\nThese features can be adjusted from the game options menu.

			%c[0,153,255,255]Rank%c[0,140,140,140] is a score system based on what a stalker has accomplished in the Zone.\n
			\nActions which you perform throughout your playthrough are recorded and each grant a varying number of points depending on the action in question.\n
			\nAs you accumulate more and more points your rank will gradually change as you pass through every milestone, with each requiring an additional 1000 points on top of the requirements of its predecessor.\n
			\nMost of these actions are logged in the statistics tab of the PDA, which also contains an in-game leaderboard that keeps track of the current top-100 highest ranking stalkers.\n
			\nThere are currently eight total ranks available:\n
			\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Rookie (0)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Trainee (1000) (+1000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Experienced (3000) (+2000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Professional (6000) (+3000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Veteran (10000) (+4000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Expert (15000) (+5000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Master (21000) (+6000)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Legend (28000) (+7000)

		<text>
			%c[0,153,255,255]Reputation%c[0,140,140,140] is a representation of how a stalker interacts with others.\n
			\nReputation is similar to rank but differs in that it isn't quite so linear - being able to both increase and decrease - and that it is based on your interactions with other stalkers rather than the environment.\n
			\nThe easiest ways to increase reputation are by completing tasks, providing first-aid, and killing your faction's enemies, whilst inversely the easiest ways to lose it are by cancelling or failing tasks, and killing neutral or friendly stalkers.\n
			\nIt should be noted that reputation is not to be confused with goodwill, which handles all stalker and faction relations. Reputation is largely an immersion-focused feature for the benefit of the player.\n
			\nThere are currently nine total reputations available:\n
			\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Terrible (-2000) (-500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Dreary (-1500) (-500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Awful (-1000) (-500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Bad (-500) (-500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Neutral (0)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Good (500) (+500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Great (1000) (+500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Brilliant (1500) (+500)\n%c[0,100,100,255]• %c[0,140,140,140]Excellent (2000) (+500)

			\nThroughout the Zone you will find many beds and sleeping bags, normally they are only used to allow the you to skip time by sleeping, however with this feature enabled they become an essential part of gameplay.\n
			\nAs time passes your character will slowly begin to feel tired, with the screen beginning to blur and shake. These effects will proceed to get worse until you find a suitable place to rest or the effects of sleep deprivation cause you to collapse from exhaustion.\n
			\nTiredness can be accelerated through consuming items such as medical kits and vodka, and negated with those such as high-caffeine energy drinks - however using too many will leave you unable to rest until their effects wear off.\n
