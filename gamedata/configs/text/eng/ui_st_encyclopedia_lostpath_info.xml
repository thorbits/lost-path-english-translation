Stalkers explore the Zone, gather resources for yourself and your group mutants day guarding their territory, and night gathering and attacking Stalker camps, grouping're no longer sitting in one place, each group is trying to consolidate its region, capture resource points and destroy the enemy. In General, the Area lives its own life and will not hesitate to take the life of a single NPC or a group.

		<text>the Concept of the addon is primarily based on events taking place after the plot of all three games in the series. The addon does not bear any global ideas and are not affected by the styling, it just extends and complements the original Call of Chernobyl. However, do not expect expansion of the globality or direct route to the plot narrative of the trilogy as this is not a standalone project, and is entirely independent from the Call of Chernobyl and its future updates.
